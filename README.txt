I'm a 21 year old self-taught student who created to plugin to help users easily create responsive tables on their wordpress website. Originally this was a simple personal project but grew to over 300+ active installs. I want to thank each and everyone of you who downloaded and used my plugin, it means a lot and I hope it has served you well. Having said this, I didn't create this plugin entirely from scratch. I made use of amazing frameworks and scripts developed by other amazing people who deserve all the credit for their work. This plugin makes use of other plugins which I have not created or contributed to in any way, I do not take credit for these works, the credits belong to their respective authors. These plugins are:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin work? =

JTRT Responsive Tables works by converting tables in csv formats, into responsive html5 markup language. 

= How does the responsiveness work? =

This plugin uses FooTables to make the responsiveness happen. It 'hides' columns on smaller sizes so the table isn't squished and looking ugly. Although it hides columns, you can always view the hidden columns by clicking on the rows. 

= Do I need to know any HTML/CSS to use this plugin? =

No, everything happens in the backend using a live representation of your table. You can manually select which columns to hide on the tablet and mobile sizes just by clicking your mouse.
