= Credits =

I'm a 22 year old self-taught student who created to plugin to help users easily create responsive tables on their wordpress website. Originally this was a simple personal project but grew to over 2000+ active installs. I want to thank each and everyone of you who downloaded and used my plugin, it means a lot and I hope it has served you well. Having said this, I didn't create this plugin entirely from scratch. I made use of amazing frameworks and scripts developed by other amazing people who deserve all the credit for their work. This plugin makes use of other plugins which I have not created or contributed to in any way, I do not take credit for these works, the credits belong to their respective authors. These plugins are:
1. [Footable](http://fooplugins.com/plugins/footable-jquery/)
3. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
4. [PapaParse](http://papaparse.com/)
5. [HandsOnTable](https://handsontable.com/)
6. [DataTables](https://datatables.net/)
4. Much love to those who helped me with issues, too many awesome people to list, love you all!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin work? =

Before this plugin worked by converting CSV files into HTML Tables, but now you can start from scratch and build your table in the backend. The ability to convert CSV files is still here, and improved graatly.  

= How does the responsiveness work? =

This plugin uses FooTables to make the responsiveness happen. It 'hides' columns on smaller sizes so the table isn't squished and looking ugly. Although it hides columns, you can always view the hidden columns by clicking on the rows. 

= Do I need to know any HTML/CSS to use this plugin? =

No, everything happens in the backend using a live representation of your table. You can manually select which columns to hide on the tablet and mobile sizes just by clicking your mouse.

= My table wont show up, I'm getting a cannot found error =

This is mainly caused by the plugin having issues saving to the backend. This issue is usually caused by updating the plugin from previous versions. If you encounter this issue and you upgraded plugins, simply re-install the new version after removing the previous. 

= My links/images wont show up in the front end =

If you can see your images/links in the backend but not on the frontend, then that means you have to set your column type to "html". The plugin does html character escaping unless you specify not to in the column options.
